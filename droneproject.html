          <h2>Overview.</h2>
          <p>
            I participated in this project along with 4 other undergraduate students and 2 faculty
            advisors at UNC Chapel Hill in Spring 2020. As a work-study student at the BeAM Makerspace
            on campus who had experience with 3D modeling and printing, my primary responsibility was
            prototyping a mount that would attach a GoPro Fusion 360 camera to the DJI Phantom 4 RTK drone.
          </p>
          <h2>Objective.</h2>
          <p>
            Using the pre-installed camera on the DJI Phantom 4 RTK and the GoPro Fusion 360, we sought to
            explore the feasibility of using drones in the field of forest conservation and management for
            data collection.
          </p>
          <h2>Design Process of the Mount.</h2>
          <p>
            As the “engineering” portion of the team, it was my job to design a mount that would reduce/eliminate
            the “jello effect” in the video footage created from the vibration of the drone. After conducting research on the topic (obtaining information on the specs of the drone and camera, types of mounts, etc.), I looked for designs that others created and posted on websites such as Thingiverse.com.
          </p>
          <p>
             From there, I created 4 different design concepts based off of these models, altering them in a 3D modeling software to fit our drone and camera. After presenting them to the rest of the team and consulting an acquaintance of one of the advisors, we opted to print and test 3 of the mounts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Upon testing, we found that one of the mounts caused the drone to be unstable and crash. The second design used two plates and braided wires to absorb the shock and vibration created from the drone. During the test flight for this design, we noticed that the plate attached to the camera and the camera itself shook erratically. Still, the video footage itself proved to be stable, with most of the jello effect eliminated. In order to further stabilize the video further, we tried more flexible wire, which eliminated the vibration of the lower plate and completely eliminated the jello effect.
          </p>
          <h2>Challenges and Experience.</h2>
          <p>
            The challenge that I faced individually was centered around my lack of experience with drones and engineering in general. I was mainly recruited as a student staff member at BeAM since I had experience with 3D modeling and printing. After researching the topic, however, I found that what the project needed of me was not that intensive, and easily do-able if enough effort was put into it.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a group, I think the highest barrier that we ran into was the shut down of the school amid the COVID-19 pandemic. This project involved a decent amount of in-person meetings and field work that was affected by the shutdown. Aside from this, we were also planning on attending and presenting our project at a conference. Despite this, I feel we adapted to these changes the best that we could, and did everything within our power to conclude the project with what was available to us.
